## Build

- Refactor the started template to suit the application development process.

- Import [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) and create the necessary directories for code-splitting.
- Import [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) dependency to execute promise based http-requests & access the API.

- Import [swiper](https://swiperjs.com/react) or [swiper@6.8.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swiper/v/6.8.4) dependency, to add the animation swipe effect on the Header component.

- Set the routes between the pages in `config/Routes`.

- Create the necessary components and style them with sass.
